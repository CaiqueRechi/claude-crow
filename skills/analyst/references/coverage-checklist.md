# Coverage checklist

This is the definition of a complete requirements survey. Every item below
ends in a covered state — `respondido`, `não se aplica` or `adiado` — before the
survey counts as 100%. The probe questions are starting points, not a script:
ask them in his language, adapted to the request, one at a time.

An item is answered only when the answer is specific enough to build and test
from. "Precisa ser seguro" does not close a security item; "login com o AD da
empresa, só a equipe de vendas vê o relatório de margem" does.
